// test-gate refuses a session that is building against failing tests when it changes one of them.
//
// The build stage hands a worker a suite that is already red and asks it to make the tests pass. The
// shortest way to a green suite is to change the assertion, and a session that does it is not being
// dishonest: a failing test looks exactly like a wrong test from the inside, and the session has no
// way to tell them apart.
//
// The rule was advice for as long as it existed, and advice is what a model weighs against everything
// else it was told. So the boundary is checked at the moment a session tries, by a process the session
// does not control.
//
// It is deliberately looser than the discipline it comes from, where the implementer never sees the
// test at all. Reading is allowed, and allowed on purpose: a build that cannot read the test cannot
// tell a failing assertion from a broken one, and it guesses instead. So this refuses the write and
// nothing else, and it names the way through, which is to say in the answer that the test is wrong.
