Feature: The operator sees the system from the console

  The console is the full screen view of every resource the system has. Its job is to show what is
  really there, so these scenarios drive it against the real control plane rather than a double of
  one, and assert on the rows it produces.

  How the console draws those rows, filters them and moves a cursor over them is a table test in
  internal/console, where it belongs. What cannot be said there is this: that the rows are the
  control plane's actual sessions and workspaces.

  The console, the API and the database all say session. It was called threads for a while, and that
  word now opens nothing, because one name across the whole system beats a console that translates.

  Background:
    Given a running control plane
    And a workspace named "acme"
    And a project named "house-bills"

  Scenario: The flat listing of every session is still one word away
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    And the operator dispatches "a different subject" to a new session
    And the operator opens the console on sessions
    Then the console lists 2 sessions

  Scenario: The console lists a workspace it can drill into
    When the operator opens the console on workspaces
    Then the console lists 1 workspace
    And the console can drill from workspaces into projects

  Scenario: Drilling into a workspace shows only that workspace's projects
    Given a second workspace named "other"
    When the operator opens the console
    And the operator drills into workspace "acme"
    Then the console lists 1 project

  # The whole tree, driven one key at a time against the real control plane. The console opens on the
  # workspaces, and each enter goes one level down: projects, then the sessions in the project.
  Scenario: The console opens at the top and each key goes one level down
    Given a session started by dispatching "read the electricity bill"
    When the operator is at the console
    Then the console is on the "workspaces" view
    When the operator presses "enter" in the console
    Then the console is on the "projects" view
    When the operator presses "enter" in the console
    Then the console is on the "sessions" view

  # And back up. Escape from every level, including the one the console opens on, which has nowhere
  # to go and must not take the console with it.
  Scenario: Escape comes back up one level at a time
    Given a session started by dispatching "read the electricity bill"
    When the operator is at the console
    And the operator presses "enter" in the console
    And the operator presses "enter" in the console
    Then the console is on the "sessions" view
    When the operator presses "esc" in the console
    Then the console is on the "projects" view
    When the operator presses "esc" in the console
    Then the console is on the "workspaces" view
    When the operator presses "esc" in the console
    Then the console is on the "workspaces" view

  # The key that was the way to a project's sessions while enter went elsewhere. Enter reaches them
  # again, and the key is kept because it is in fingers.
  Scenario: A project still reaches its own sessions in one key
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator is at the console
    And the operator presses "enter" in the console
    Then the console is on the "projects" view
    When the operator presses "s" in the console
    Then the console is on the "sessions" view

  # The short forms are what an operator's fingers reach for, so each one lands on the same view.
  Scenario: A short word for the sessions view opens it
    When the operator opens the console by typing "s"
    Then the console is showing sessions

  # The system dropped these words, so the console must not quietly teach one back. This is the way off
  # them, the way a named refusal is the command line's.
  Scenario: A word the system dropped opens nothing
    Then typing "threads" in the console opens nothing
    And typing "turns" in the console opens nothing

  Scenario: An empty system lists nothing rather than failing
    When the operator opens the console on sessions
    Then the console lists 0 sessions

  # An identifier is what actions use, a name is what the operator reads. These say the console shows
  # the second without losing the first.
  Scenario: The console names a session's workspace rather than showing its identifier
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    And the operator opens the console on sessions
    Then the console shows the session's workspace as "acme"

  Scenario: The console shortens identifiers so a row can be read
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    And the operator opens the console on sessions
    Then the console shows the session identifier shortened

  # Enter is the obvious key on a conversation, and on this view it used to do nothing at all, because
  # a session has nothing to drill into.
  Scenario: Enter on a session opens its conversation
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator opens the console on sessions
    And the operator presses enter on the selected session
    Then the console opens that session's conversation

  # A console with a conversation beside it: enter is how the operator changes which
  # one. Every open used to land on the driver, whatever the cursor was on, because the session the
  # console handed over was dropped on the way to the pane. The list had several conversations in it
  # and every key gave back the same one.
  #
  # This drives the console's own reducer over the live control plane and reads the pane the operator
  # is looking at. A scenario that stopped at the call the key made is what let this ship.
  Scenario: Enter opens the conversation under the cursor, three times over
    Given a session started by dispatching "the first one"
    And a session started by dispatching "the second one" on a new session
    And a session started by dispatching "the third one" on a new session
    When the operator opens the console beside a conversation
    And the operator presses enter on each session in turn
    Then the conversation beside the console was that session's own each time

  # A first exec that failed leaves a session holding no conversation. Enter said so and stopped,
  # which left a row in the listing nobody could open. The system names a conversation for it instead.
  Scenario: Enter on a session whose first exec failed opens a conversation the system names
    Given a session whose first exec failed
    When the operator opens the console on sessions
    And the operator presses enter on the selected session
    Then the console opens a conversation the system can name

  # Every destructive key asks first. These drive the console's own reducer against the real control
  # plane, so "nothing was stopped" is a fact about the store rather than about a double.
  Scenario: Backspace asks before it stops a session, and stops nothing until yes
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator opens the console and presses backspace on the session
    Then the console asks whether to stop that session
    And the session is reported as idle

  Scenario: Answering yes stops the session
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator opens the console and presses backspace on the session
    And the operator answers "y"
    Then the session is reported as stopped

  Scenario: Anything that is not yes cancels, and stops nothing
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator opens the console and presses backspace on the session
    And the operator answers "n"
    Then the session is reported as idle

  # Archiving from the console, driven through its own reducer: the session leaves the view it was put
  # away from and turns up in the archived one, with its conversation intact.
  Scenario: An archived session leaves the sessions view for the archived one
    Given a session started by dispatching "remember this"
    When the operator opens the console and archives the session
    Then the console lists 0 sessions
    And the archived view lists 1 session
    And the archived session still holds its conversation

  Scenario: Acting on a row still uses the whole identifier
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator opens the console on sessions
    And the operator stops the selected session from the console
    Then the session is reported as stopped

  # The console shows what is running. What a session already ran is read at the command line, where
  # the whole of an answer fits, so the key that opened the reading says where the reading went
  # rather than doing nothing.
  Scenario Outline: A key that opened a session's history says what to type instead
    Given a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator is at the console on the "sessions" view
    And the operator presses "<key>" in the console
    Then the console screen says "krewe exec list"
    And the console is on the "sessions" view

    Examples:
      | key |
      | t   |
      | l   |
      | h   |

  # The wizard makes one thing. It shipped able to make only a whole new system, because the workspace
  # and the project questions were both required on the way to anything else, so adding a project to a
  # workspace that already existed meant dropping to the command line and knowing what to type.
  #
  # These drive the console's own reducer against the real control plane, so "and nothing else" is a
  # fact about the store rather than about a double.

  Scenario: The wizard makes a workspace on its own
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | workspace |
      | other     |
    Then the system has 2 workspaces
    And the system has 1 project

  Scenario: The wizard adds a project to a workspace that already exists
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | project   |
      | acme      |
      | gardening |
    Then the system has 2 projects
    And the system has 1 workspace

  Scenario: The wizard sets the subscription token on a workspace that already exists
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | secret           |
      | acme             |
      | sk-ant-oat-typed |
    Then the secrets backend holds "sk-ant-oat-typed" for that workspace
    And the system has 1 workspace

  Scenario: The wizard writes the context of a project that already exists
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | context                  |
      | acme                     |
      | house-bills              |
      | pay the water bill first |
    And the operator asks where context lives
    Then the project's context reads "pay the water bill first"
    And the system has 1 project

  Scenario: The wizard starts a session in a project that already exists
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | dangerous   |
      | hello       |
    Then the system has 1 session
    And the system has 1 workspace
    And the system has 1 project

  # An exec takes as long as the job takes, which is minutes, and the console has a screen to draw.
  # The wizard waited for one anyway: it held every key while it waited, gave up at thirty seconds,
  # and left behind a session with a container, a row, and no conversation in it. The operator saw a
  # frozen "making it" and then an error, and read the freeze as the container being slow to start.
  #
  # The exec is held open here rather than timed, because what is being specified is what is true
  # while an exec runs, and a scenario that waits a duration for that passes by accident.
  Scenario: The wizard comes back before the exec it started has finished
    Given the model takes longer over an exec than anybody will wait
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | dangerous   |
      | hello       |
    Then the console is asking nothing
    And the system has 1 session
    And an exec is under way
    And the system's one session is reported as running
    When the model finishes the exec
    Then the system's one session is reported as idle
    And the session carries what the model said

  # An exec runs inside the system's own process, so nothing of it survives that process going down. A
  # row still saying running on the way up is an exec that died with the last one, and left alone it
  # reads as a conversation that has been thinking since the restart.
  Scenario: A session left mid exec by a restart is settled rather than left running
    Given the model takes longer over an exec than anybody will wait
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | dangerous   |
      | hello       |
    And an exec is under way
    And the control plane restarts
    Then the system's one session is reported as failed

  # Escape at any point makes nothing at all. The last row here is typed and never accepted, so escape
  # lands on a half answered question rather than on a finished one.
  #
  # That the wizard also forgets the half typed token is asserted in internal/console, against the
  # model the moment it closes. From out here the wizard is no longer drawn, so a console still holding
  # the token would look exactly like one that had dropped it.
  Scenario: Escaping the wizard makes nothing
    When the operator abandons the wizard after typing:
      | secret           |
      | acme             |
      | sk-ant-oat-typed |
    Then the secrets backend holds nothing for that workspace
    And the system has 1 workspace

  # The way off the old wizard, not only the way onto the new one. It used to open by asking for a new
  # workspace name, so the first thing anybody typed was a name.
  Scenario: A name typed at the first question is refused rather than making a workspace
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | acme-two |
    Then the wizard says there is nothing called "acme-two" to make
    And the system has 1 workspace

  # The wizard made everything it was asked for and then stayed drawn over the list it had already
  # refreshed, so nothing looked like it had happened, and the next enter was taken as an answer to a
  # question nobody was asked.
  #
  # What a key does while the system is still making it is a table test in internal/console instead: out
  # here the make completes inside the step, so there is no working window to press a key into, and a
  # scenario written for it passed against its own mutation.
  Scenario: The wizard closes when it has made what it was asked for, and the list shows it
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | dangerous   |
      | hello       |
    Then the console is asking nothing
    And the console lists what the wizard made

  # The header was three rows across the top of the window: a wordmark in block letters, one version
  # string and one memory figure. It is one footer row now, under the list, and the rows it took are
  # rows of the listing. See issue 608.
  #
  # These drive the console's own reducer against the real control plane, so what is asserted is what
  # the operator would be looking at.
  Scenario: The footer says where you are, how to leave, and what this build is
    When the operator drills into a workspace
    Then the footer says where the operator is standing
    And the footer says how to go back
    And the footer says which build this is
    And the footer says how to reach everything else
    And the footer names the product

  # The rows the header took are the list's now, and a wordmark drawn anywhere would take them back.
  Scenario: Nothing draws a header any more
    When the operator looks at the console
    Then no wordmark is drawn anywhere on the screen
    And the console draws one row under the list

  # A footer is one row, so it cannot wrap. Something has to give, and it is never the half that says
  # where you are: a person who cannot see that has to guess, while a person who cannot see the build
  # reads it in the help panel. The order the right half gives way in is a table test in
  # internal/console, which can fix the build string these widths depend on.
  Scenario Outline: The footer gives up the right half before the left, narrowest first
    When the operator looks at the console <columns> columns wide
    Then the footer still says where the operator is standing
    And the footer carries <what is left>

    Examples:
      | columns | what is left                    |
      | 120     | the build, help and the product |
      | 84      | the build, help and the product |
      | 10      | nothing on the right            |

  Scenario: The help panel carries everything the header dropped
    When the operator looks at the console and asks for help
    Then the help panel names the system it is pointed at
    And the help panel names what the system is running
    And the help panel says what the keys on this view do
    And the help panel never asks a question it has already answered

  # A sandbox is born with its capabilities and never drifts, so the mode is decided when the session
  # starts rather than changed afterwards, which costs a restart. A session born unable to act is a
  # session that apologises: on this system one was asked to clone a repository and answered that it
  # needed approval from somebody who was not there.
  Scenario: The wizard asks what a session may do, and the session is born in it
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | plan        |
      | hello       |
    Then the system has 1 session
    And that session's mode is "plan"

  # Tab is the other way to answer a question like this one: cycling to a candidate rather than
  # spelling it out. The wizard offers what a step can be answered with everywhere it asks one of a
  # fixed set of things, not only here, but the mode is where it matters most, an operator choosing
  # what a session may do without asking rather than typing "dangerous" correctly.
  Scenario: Tab fills in the mode without typing it
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
    And the operator presses tab 3 times to choose the mode, then sends "hello"
    Then the system has 1 session
    And that session's mode is "bypassPermissions"

  Scenario: The wizard refuses a mode that is not one of the three
    When the operator answers the wizard with:
      | session     |
      | acme        |
      | house-bills |
      | whatever    |
    Then the console says "not one of them"

  # A listing where every row is one colour has to be read one row at a time, which is what a listing
  # is for avoiding. Every row in every view carries a state, and a state was being drawn over the
  # whole line, so the workspace, the project and the mode all arrived on screen in the same green.
  #
  # The state moved onto the status cell, which is where the sessions tool keeps it. This drives the
  # real console over the real control plane, so what is asserted is the screen the operator has.
  Scenario: A session's row is coloured cell by cell rather than all in its state
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    And the operator dispatches "a different subject" to a new session
    And the operator looks at the sessions listing
    Then a session's row carries more than one colour
    And the row says how the session is doing in its status cell

  # The view that listed what a session ran is gone from the console. Every spelling that opened it is
  # still in fingers and in notes, so each one says what to type at the command line instead. A word
  # that quietly stopped working is how an operator learns to distrust the rest of the command bar.
  Scenario Outline: A word that opened the history says what to type instead
    When the operator types "<typed>" into the command bar
    Then the console screen says "krewe exec list"

    Examples:
      | typed   |
      | e       |
      | exec    |
      | execs   |
      | history |

  # The path of a project, read where the operator already stands. Until now the answer to "what is
  # left, and what is waiting on me" was a command line away.
  Scenario: The path of a project opens by name
    Given the project's path is:
      """
      ## 1. The store holds a project's brief
      ## 2. The design reaches the session
      ## 3. The riskiest assumption is measured
      """
    When the operator opens the console on the project's path
    Then the console lists 3 steps

  # The letters p and s open projects and sessions, so this view is reached by a word rather than by
  # a letter, and both spellings land on it.
  Scenario: The word steps opens the same view
    Given the project's path is:
      """
      ## 1. The store holds a project's brief
      """
    When the operator opens the console by typing "steps"
    Then the console is showing the path
    And the console lists 1 step

  # How far a project got, and where krewe stands, on the listing the operator already reads. Both
  # answers were a command line away, one project at a time.
  Scenario: The projects listing counts the path, the trust and the flight
    Given the project's path is:
      """
      ## 1. The store holds a project's brief
      ## 2. The design reaches the session
      ## 3. The riskiest assumption is measured
      """
    And the operator wrote the project's design as "the design, whole"
    When the operator drills into workspace "acme"
    Then the projects listing draws "0/3" in the "path" column
    And the projects listing draws "0 (0/5)" in the "trust" column
    And the projects listing draws "0/10" in the "flight" column

  # Nothing there is not a count of zero. A project nobody wrote a path for draws an empty cell, so
  # the column answers "which of these has been designed" at a glance.
  Scenario: A project with no path and no design says nothing in those columns
    When the operator drills into workspace "acme"
    Then the projects listing says nothing in the "path" column
    And the projects listing says nothing in the "trust" column
