// Package features holds the executable specification of Quay Krewe.
//
// The feature files next to this one state what the product does, in language a reader who is not
// holding the code can follow. The steps below drive the control plane over its real gRPC interface,
// the same one the command line tool, the channels and the dashboard use, so a scenario survives the
// implementation changing underneath it.
//
// Scope this to the control plane contract. A behaviour that is better said as a Go table test
// belongs in the package it tests, not here.
//
// The model runner and the sandbox provider are doubles, so these scenarios are fast and need no
// Docker daemon and no subscription. They therefore prove routing, session identity, sandbox
// lifecycle and error handling, and they deliberately do not prove that a real exec executes. That
// is the job of the dispatch smoke in continuous integration, which boots the composed stack and
// runs an exec for real, and of the gated test in internal/model that needs a live subscription.
