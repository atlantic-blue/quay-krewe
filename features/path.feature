Feature: A project holds a numbered path of steps

  A design says what to build. It does not say what to build first, and a project had nowhere to keep
  the answer, so the atomised changes lived in whoever wrote them down.

  The path is that list, and it belongs to one feature of the project. A project delivers several
  features at once and each one has a path of its own, so writing one leaves the others whole and two
  features may each hold a step 3. Each step carries one intention, the files it writes, what proves
  it, and the name of the scenario krewe runs to check it.

  A step is named as one token, <feature>.<number>. A bare number was the whole address before the
  path belonged to a feature, so it is refused rather than guessed at.

  The control plane parses the document rather than the caller, so the console and the command line
  send the same words and cannot drift on the grammar.

  A step that names no predecessor waits for the number below it, and step one waits for nobody. A
  default of nothing would make the gate worthless, because every step would be ready at once.

  A feature is delivered in milestones. One heading with one hash names a milestone, and every step
  under it belongs to it, so a reader sees what a run of steps adds up to. Step numbers stay unique
  across the whole feature and do not start again under each milestone.

  There is no way to empty a path. A document with no step heading is refused, so a wrong file path
  cannot take somebody's path away.

  The session working in the project reads the path in its own working directory, in number order.
  That is what lets a session start from what is true: a session on step 4 reads what steps 1 to 3
  produced.
