Feature: A project carries what it is for and what was designed

  A project had nowhere to keep two things a person needs before any work starts: what the project is
  for, and what was designed for it. Both lived in somebody's head, or in a file on one machine, so a
  session starting in the project was told neither.

  The system keeps them on the project itself. The brief is one paragraph. The design is a document,
  written whole, and read back whole so it can be piped.

  Approval is a statement about one text. Any write to the design clears it, and the write says so,
  so a person learns the rule by reading the output rather than by being surprised later.

  Background:
    Given a running control plane
    And a workspace named "acme"
    And a project named "house-bills"

  Scenario: A project that nobody designed says so
    When the operator reads the project's design
    Then the project has no design yet

  Scenario: A brief says what the project is for
    When the operator sets the project's brief to "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the brief reads "keep the household bills paid on time"

  # An empty brief is a value, not an absence. Clearing one is the only way back, and a command that
  # refused the empty string would leave a wrong brief in place for ever.
  Scenario: An empty brief clears what was there
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    When the operator sets the project's brief to ""
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the brief reads ""

  # The body is the largest text in the system, and a design read short is a design read wrong.
  Scenario: A design body is read back whole
    When the operator writes the project's design as "# Bills\n\nOne paragraph.\n\n- a point\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design body reads "# Bills\n\nOne paragraph.\n\n- a point\n"

  Scenario: A brief and a design body are separate statements
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    When the operator writes the project's design as "# Bills\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the brief reads "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the design body reads "# Bills\n"

  # The word is about one text. Approving records it, and any write to the design takes it away in
  # the same write, so a row never says approved over a body nobody has read.
  Scenario: The operator approves a design
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator approves the project's design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design is approved

  Scenario: Rewriting an approved design takes the approval away
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    When the operator writes the project's design as "# Bills, again\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design is not approved

  # A brief says what the project is for. It says nothing about what was designed, so it cannot take
  # the operator's word away.
  Scenario: Writing a brief leaves the approval alone
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    When the operator sets the project's brief to "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design is approved

  Scenario: Approving a project with no design is refused
    When the operator approves the project's design
    Then the control plane refuses it as the wrong state
    And the refusal suggests "krewe design set"

  # The gate is only real while nothing inside a sandbox can pass it. A session writes a design, and
  # that write clears the approval, so a session that could then approve it would be agreeing with
  # itself.
  Scenario: A session cannot approve a design
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the driver asks to approve the project's design
    Then the driver is refused, told the call is the operator's to make
    And the operator reads the project's design
    And the design is not approved

  Scenario: The design of a project that does not exist is refused
    When the operator reads the design of a project that does not exist
    Then the control plane refuses it as not found

  Scenario: A design call that names no project is refused
    When the operator reads the design without saying which project
    Then the control plane refuses it as invalid

  # A brief is one paragraph naming what the project is for. A page of prose in that field is a
  # design in the wrong column. Nothing is refused: the text is kept whole and the length is said.
  Scenario: A brief over the mark warns and is kept whole
    When the operator sets the project's brief to 2500 characters
    Then the write warns about the length
    And the brief is kept whole

  Scenario: A design body under the mark warns about nothing
    When the operator writes a design of 500 characters
    Then the write warns about nothing

  # The session that wrote the design is recorded, and the operator records nobody. It is a claim the
  # system keeps rather than one it checks, and it grants nothing.
  Scenario: A design written by a session records that session
    When the session "sess-1" writes the project's design as "# Bills\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design says it was written by "sess-1"

  Scenario: A design written by the operator records nobody
    Given the session "sess-1" wrote the project's design as "# Bills\n"
    When the operator writes the project's design as "# Bills again\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design says it was written by ""

  # These scenarios run the command line tool as a caller runs it: its own process, its own standard
  # output, its own exit status.

  Scenario: The operator writes a brief and reads it back with the tool
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    When the caller sets the project's brief to "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the caller reads the project's design
    Then standard output carries "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: The operator writes a design from a file and reads it back
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And a design file saying "# Bills\n\nPay the water bill first.\n"
    When the caller writes the design from that file
    And the caller reads the project's design
    Then standard output carries "Pay the water bill first."
    And the command succeeds

  # Said on every write, whether or not the design was approved before it. A person who reads it
  # twice learns that approval is a statement about one text.
  Scenario: Writing a design says the approval is cleared
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And a design file saying "# Bills\n"
    When the caller writes the design from that file
    Then standard output carries "the approval is cleared"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: The operator approves a design with the tool and reads it back
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And a design file saying "# Bills\n"
    And the caller wrote the design from that file
    When the caller approves the design
    And the caller reads the project's design
    Then standard output carries "approved"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: Approving a project with no design tells the caller how to write one
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    When the caller approves the design
    Then standard error says "krewe design set"
    And the command fails

  Scenario: A project with no design tells the caller how to write one
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    When the caller reads the project's design
    Then standard output carries "has no design yet"
    And standard output carries "krewe design set"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: An empty design file is refused
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And a design file saying ""
    When the caller writes the design from that file
    Then standard error says "an empty design is not a design"
    And the command fails

  Scenario: Writing a design without saying which file is refused
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    When the caller writes the design without naming a file
    Then standard error says "usage: krewe design set"
    And the command fails

  # The design is a document, and a document is written in an editor. Krewe opens the operator's own
  # editor on the body it holds, then sends back what was saved. The file it opens is a draft, and it
  # is removed afterwards, because the design lives in the store.

  Scenario: The editor opens the design as it stands
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And an editor that writes "# Bills, again\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    Then the editor was given "# Bills\n"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: Editing a design and saving writes the new text into the store
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And an editor that writes "# Bills, again\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design body reads "# Bills, again\n"

  # A draft left behind is a second copy of the design on one machine, and the next reader cannot
  # tell which of the two is the one krewe holds.
  Scenario: The file the editor opened is removed afterwards
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And an editor that writes "# Bills, again\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    Then the file the editor opened is gone

  # The tool cannot tell a text nobody touched from a rewritten one that reads the same, so it does
  # not try. It writes, and it says the approval went, because an operator who does not know that
  # keeps building against a design krewe no longer treats as approved.
  Scenario: Leaving the editor without changing anything still writes
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And an editor that changes nothing
    When the caller edits the design
    Then standard output carries "the approval is cleared"
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: Editing an approved design takes the approval away
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    And an editor that changes nothing
    When the caller edits the design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design is not approved

  # An editor that stops with an error is somebody quitting the edit. Writing the draft back anyway
  # would take the approval away for an edit nobody made.
  Scenario: An editor that stops with an error writes nothing
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And an editor that stops with an error
    When the caller edits the design
    Then standard error says "nothing was written"
    And the command fails
    And the operator reads the project's design
    And the design body reads "# Bills\n"

  # VISUAL, then EDITOR, then vi. It is the order git and crontab use, and vi is there because most
  # machines have neither variable set and a command that refused would be dead on all of them.

  Scenario: VISUAL is the editor when it is set
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And VISUAL names an editor that writes "# from VISUAL\n"
    And EDITOR names an editor that writes "# from EDITOR\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design body reads "# from VISUAL\n"

  Scenario: EDITOR is the editor when VISUAL is not set
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And EDITOR names an editor that writes "# from EDITOR\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design body reads "# from EDITOR\n"

  Scenario: vi is the editor when neither is set
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is set
    And the vi on the path writes "# from vi\n"
    When the caller edits the design
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design body reads "# from vi\n"

  # The editor is doubled here as well, so a refusal that stopped working fails this scenario
  # rather than opening the real vi and waiting for somebody to quit it.
  Scenario: Editing with more than one address is refused
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And an editor that changes nothing
    When the caller edits the design of two projects
    Then standard error says "usage: krewe design edit"
    And the command fails

  # The session working in the project reads what the project is for, on every exec, out of its own
  # memory file. The design itself is a file beside it: the summary is read every time and the
  # document is opened by a model that decides it needs it.

  Scenario: A session reads what the project is for
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n\nPay the water bill first.\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "This project is house-bills."
    And the session's memory file carries "keep the household bills paid on time"

  Scenario: A session finds the whole design in its working directory
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n\nPay the water bill first.\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's design file reads "# Bills\n\nPay the water bill first.\n"

  Scenario: The memory file sends the session to the design file
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "Read .krewe/design.md before you start."

  # A session reads the design and has to know whether anybody agreed to it. An unapproved design is
  # still a design worth reading, and the line says which it is rather than leaving the session to
  # assume.
  Scenario: A session reads that the design is not approved
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "The design is not approved yet."

  Scenario: A session reads that the design is approved
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "The design is approved, on "

  # A project with a brief and no design has nothing to say about approval, and the section is capped,
  # so it spends no line on a word about a document that does not exist.
  Scenario: A project with a brief and no design says nothing about approval
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file does not carry "The design is"

  # A line telling the model to open a file that is not there sends it to open nothing.
  Scenario: A project with a brief and no design does not send the session to a file
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the session's memory file does not carry ".krewe/design.md"
    And the session has no design file

  Scenario: A project with no design puts no design section in the memory file
    Given the operator sets the project's context to "pay the water bill first"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's memory file carries "pay the water bill first"
    And the session's memory file carries no design section

  # The section is read again on every exec of every session in the project, so its cost is paid per
  # exec. The brief is the only part whose length nobody controls, so it is the part that is cut.
  Scenario: A very long brief is cut so the section stays small
    Given the project's brief is 5000 characters
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the design section is under 400 characters
    And the session's memory file carries "Read .krewe/design.md before you start."

  # The section is rendered state, never context. A mark the read back does not know is swept into
  # the session's own context, stored as though a person typed it, and rendered again underneath
  # itself on the next exec.
  Scenario: The design section is not carried twice
    Given the project's brief is "keep the household bills paid on time"
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    And the operator dispatches "and again" to the same session
    Then the memory file carries one design section
    And the session's context does not carry the design section

  Scenario: Rewriting the design gives the session the new text
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator writes the project's design as "# Bills, again\n"
    Then the session's design file reads "# Bills, again\n"

  # A design emptied on purpose must not stay readable in the working directory, or what the session
  # reads and what the store holds disagree.
  Scenario: Emptying the design takes the file away
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator writes the project's design as ""
    Then the session has no design file

  # The contracts a project builds against sit beside the design, on the same row. They are a second
  # body: a session opens the file when it needs one, and the memory file never carries them, because
  # that file is read on every exec of every session in the project and a contracts document is long.

  Scenario: A session finds the whole contracts document in its working directory
    Given the project's contracts are "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n\nThe row is made on first use.\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session's contracts file reads "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n\nThe row is made on first use.\n"

  # The rule this whole capability turns on. The approval is the operator's word about the design
  # body, and the contracts are read out of that body, so writing them is not a design that changed.
  # A write that cleared the word would ask the operator to approve a design nobody rewrote.
  Scenario: Writing a contracts document leaves the approval alone
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    When the operator sets the project's contracts to "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the design is approved
    And the contracts read "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n"

  Scenario: A contracts document on a project with no design makes the row
    When the operator sets the project's contracts to "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n"
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the contracts read "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n"
    And the design body reads ""

  Scenario: Rewriting the contracts gives the session the new text
    Given the project's contracts are "### STORE-2\n"
    And a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator sets the project's contracts to "### STORE-2\n### STORE-23\n"
    Then the session's contracts file reads "### STORE-2\n### STORE-23\n"

  # A file that exists and says nothing costs a read.
  Scenario: A project with no contracts document has no contracts file
    Given the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    When the operator dispatches "hello" to the project
    Then the session has no contracts file

  # An empty body is a value rather than an absence: it is how a project says it carries no contracts
  # document. The store keeps it, and the session gets no file at all.
  Scenario: A project with an empty contracts body has no contracts file
    Given the project's contracts are "### STORE-2\n"
    And a session started by dispatching "hello"
    When the operator sets the project's contracts to ""
    Then the session has no contracts file

  # A contracts document is the largest text this row carries after the design body, and a body read
  # short is a body read wrong.
  Scenario: A contracts document is read back whole at 140,000 characters
    When the operator sets the project's contracts to 140000 characters
    And the operator reads the project's design
    Then the contracts are kept whole

  # A write that fails leaves the session without the file. It never fails the exec: the session works
  # in the project whether or not the render reached its working directory.
  Scenario: A contracts document that cannot be written does not fail the exec
    Given the project's contracts are "### STORE-2\n"
    And a session started by dispatching "hello"
    And the contracts document cannot be written
    When the operator dispatches "and again" to the same session
    Then the session was asked "and again"

  Scenario: The operator writes the contracts from a file and reads them back
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And a contracts file saying "### STORE-2: SetProjectBrief\n"
    When the caller writes the contracts from that file
    And the caller reads the project's contracts
    Then standard output is the contracts document and one newline
    And the command succeeds

  # Said on every write. An operator who reads a contracts write as taking the approval away goes and
  # approves a design nobody rewrote.
  Scenario: Writing contracts says the approval is untouched, and leaves it
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    And the project's design is "# Bills\n"
    And the operator approved the project's design
    And a contracts file saying "### STORE-2\n"
    When the caller writes the contracts from that file
    Then standard output carries "the approval is untouched"
    And the caller reads the project's design
    And standard output carries "approval: approved "
    And the command succeeds

  Scenario: A project with no contracts document tells the caller how to write one
    Given the system listens on an address the tool can dial
    When the caller reads the project's contracts
    Then standard output carries "this project has no contracts document yet"
    And standard output carries "krewe design contracts"
    And the command succeeds
