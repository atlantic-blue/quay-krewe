// It sorts on the same stamp the listing renders because the two used to disagree. The order was the
// created stamp and the column was this one, so a session made a week ago and used an hour ago sat
// below one made yesterday and untouched since, and a real listing of forty five sessions read
// 1d, 1d, 1d, 7d, 7d, 7d, 1d, 7d. A column in no order is a column nobody can read.
//
// The identifier breaks a tie, so two sessions that share a moment keep one order between reads.
//
// Postgres writes the same rule as `coalesce(archived_at, updated_at) desc, id`, and storetest holds
// the two to it. The stamp comes from internal/session, which is also where the age column reads it,
// so the order and the cell can never be computed from different fields.
