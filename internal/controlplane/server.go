// Package controlplane implements the spine: the ControlPlaneService gRPC API backed by a durable
// store, a secrets store, and a model runner. Channels feed it through the event log; the dashboard
// and CLI drive it through the API.
//
// The server holds no domain state of its own. Workspaces and sessions live in the store, so a restart
// resumes conversations instead of orphaning them. The one thing it still keeps in the process is
// the map of live sandboxes, which is a handle to a running container rather than a fact worth
// keeping; reattaching those after a restart is its own job.
