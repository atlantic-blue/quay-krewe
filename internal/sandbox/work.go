//
// The reason this exists: a session finished the work, wrote the file, and the job stopped telling a
// person to go into the container and push what was inside it. The bytes were never in the container
// alone. A working directory is a bind mount and a workspace's volume is another, so the system was
// holding the work the whole time and had no way to name it.

// Place is one directory a session's work could be in, in the three views that matter. They are three
// paths to one directory, and every caller here needs a different one of them: the system reads Dir,
// an operator opens Host, and a command run inside the container is given Sandbox.

	// command run in there is pointed at.

// lives; a system that keeps no volume is told by the same brief to clone into the session's own
// directory instead. Looking in one of them would leave half the sessions unreadable.
