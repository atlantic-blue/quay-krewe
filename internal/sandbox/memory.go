// A sandbox's memory files are composed: the model reads two files and the system has four levels to
// say something at, so each file carries the levels that belong to it, in order, marked.

// The marks are how an edit is read back. Something inside the sandbox writing into its own memory has
// learned something, and the system has to be able to tell which level it belongs to rather than
// throwing the lot into one. They are HTML comments, which is what markdown has for a note the reader
// does not need.

// somebody wrote and the system keeps; this is rendered from the skills the workspace holds, so reading
// it back would store a derived thing as though a person had typed it.
//
// It still has to be named when a memory file is read back, because text under a mark the build does
// not know is swept into the innermost level rather than dropped. Named, it is recognised and left
// where it is.

//
// A section like the skills index and deliberately not a level of context: it is rendered from what
// the project's design row holds, so reading it back would store the system's own rendering as
// though a person had typed it, and the next exec would render it again underneath itself.

// A section like the design summary and deliberately not a level of context. The session writes it,

// what the session understood is held in one place rather than in two that can disagree.
//
// It has to be named wherever a memory file is read back, for the reason SkillsScope gives: text
