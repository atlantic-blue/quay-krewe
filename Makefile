#
# A first run used to be four commands, and the order mattered. Miss `make config` and compose reads
# a file that is not there. Miss `make sandbox-image` and the first exec fails on a missing image,
# which reads as a broken system rather than a missing step. So this is the whole first run, and the
# four commands underneath it stay callable on their own for anybody rebuilding one part.
#
# Each step is a sub make rather than a prerequisite, because the order is the point and a parallel
# make is free to run prerequisites in any order it likes. Make stops on the first recipe line that
# fails, so nothing below a refusal runs and nothing prints "the system is up" over a build that did
# not happen.
#
# Running it twice is safe. `config` writes nothing over a configuration file that exists, the builds
# are builds, and `up-check` is where a system that is already working gets a say before compose
# replaces the services under it.
#
# What it cannot do is mint the model credential, so it ends by printing the commands that are the
# operator's, in full, rather than sending them to a document.
